DynFileFS can be statically compiled with buildroot.
Just copy all files from here to, for example, packages/unionfs in buildroot and select unionfs for compilation.
I do not bother providing proper way to integrate this into buildroot, sorry, just replace unionfs with this :)

Problem is, buildroot is configured so that libfuse and fuse* filesystems cannot be statically compiled (uclibc problem)
You need to change the following:

Build options -> libraries -> static only
Toolchain -> C library -> musl

Then you need to remove BR2_STATIC_LIBS references in packages/libfuse/Config.in
and update packages/libfuse/libfuse.mk to copy libfuse.* instead of libfuse.so* to target
